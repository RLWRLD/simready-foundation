# Known sample asset deletions

## Purpose

Deleting a sample asset is a reviewed operation, not an incidental filesystem
change. Every asset intentionally removed from `sample_content/manifest.csv`
must have one TOML record in this directory.

`nv_core/sr_specs/tests/validate_sample_content.py` compares the current branch
with the MR target branch when present, otherwise the default branch. When an
asset from that compare branch is absent from the current manifest and
validation results, the test passes only if a valid record identifies the exact
deleted asset path.

## Required format

Store one deletion per `*.toml` file directly in this directory:

```toml
[deletion]
asset_path = "sample_content/path/to/deleted/root.usd"
reason = "Why this asset was intentionally removed."
```

The filename is descriptive and does not participate in matching. Matching uses
the value of `deletion.asset_path`.

Both fields are required:

- `asset_path` must be a TOML string containing the exact repository-relative
  path formerly listed in `sample_content/manifest.csv`.
- `reason` must be a TOML string containing at least one non-whitespace
  character.

Additional fields, including an optional date, are ignored and do not gate a
deletion. Additional TOML files in nested directories are not loaded.

## Path rules

`asset_path` is well-formed only when all these conditions hold:

- it starts with `sample_content/`;
- it has no leading or trailing whitespace;
- it uses forward slashes, never backslashes;
- it is repository-relative, not an absolute or drive-qualified path;
- it contains no empty path components, including doubled slashes; and
- it contains no `.` or `..` path components.

For example:

```toml
asset_path = "sample_content/common_assets/props_general/example/simready_usd/example.usd"
```

Malformed path examples include:

```toml
asset_path = "C:/repo/sample_content/example.usd"        # absolute
asset_path = "sample_content\\example.usd"               # backslashes
asset_path = "sample_content/../outside/example.usd"     # traversal
asset_path = "sample_content//example.usd"               # empty component
asset_path = " sample_content/example.usd"               # surrounding whitespace
```

## Malformed records

The test rejects a record when:

- the file is not valid TOML;
- the `[deletion]` table is absent or is not a table;
- `asset_path` or `reason` is missing;
- a required field has the wrong TOML type;
- `asset_path` violates any path rule;
- `reason` is empty or whitespace-only; or
- another TOML record contains the same `asset_path`.

## Repository-state enforcement

A well-formed record must also agree with the current repository state:

- the asset must be absent from `sample_content/manifest.csv`;
- the asset path must not exist on disk; and
- a compare-branch asset removed from the current manifest must have a matching
  record.

Therefore:

- deleting only the file still fails because the manifest entry remains;
- deleting the file and manifest row still fails without a TOML record;
- adding the TOML while the asset or manifest row remains still fails; and
- deleting the file and manifest row with a matching TOML record is accepted.

Remove the TOML record if the asset is restored.
