# SimReady Benchmark Overview

Benchmarking goes beyond schema validation. It opens a SimReady asset in
the target engine, NVIDIA Kit, or NVIDIA Isaac Sim, exercises it, and records
what happens. Schema validation, through the [SimReady Validation Workflow](../validate_workflow.md),
checks an asset against the SimReady requirements for a profile without running
the engine. Benchmarking catches behavior that schema validation cannot detect
before the asset reaches a production pipeline.

## The Tool and the Tests

Benchmarking is driven by the `simready-benchmark` tool. The bundled FET test
families are part of the SimReady Foundation and target NVIDIA Kit and NVIDIA
Isaac Sim. An installed Foundation tier advertises its catalogs and bundled
runtime-test package through the `simready.tier` entry point. During source
development, `--foundations-path` selects a Foundation checkout; `--tests-path`
is reserved for adding an independent unpublished test package.
[Running Tests](running.md) shows each workflow.

## Test Families

Each asset runs only the tests that its features and profiles call for.

The bundled suite groups tests into families by feature, as shown in the following table:

Family labels such as `FET001` are compact reporting groups and CLI filter
prefixes, not feature manifest IDs. Runtime results are attributed through the
canonical IDs declared by each test, such as `FET_001_STANDARD`. Some families
map to multiple runtime variants, so tools must read the test declarations
rather than derive a manifest name from the family label.

* - Family
  - Validates
* - [FET001](tests/fet001-visual.md)
  - Visual presence, normals, back-face culling, and lighting.
* - [FET003](tests/fet003-physics.md)
  - Ground drop with settling and slope drop for Standard, PhysX, and Newton rigid bodies.
* - [FET004](tests/fet004-multibody.md)
  - Multi-body and joint discovery and movement.
* - [FET005](tests/fet005-grasp.md)
  - Grasp and lift, where a gripper grasps the asset and raises it.
* - [FET011](tests/fet011-semantic-labels.md)
  - Semantic-label behavior in the RTX segmentation pipeline.
* - [FET022](tests/fet022-driven-joints.md)
  - Driven joints: range, velocity, mimic behavior, coordination, and inverse kinematics (IK).
* - [FET028](tests/fet028-gripper.md)
  - Gripper close, lift, shake, and drop.

Only enabled tests registered by the bundled tier suite are documented here.
Use `simready-benchmark --list-tests` to inspect the tests available in the
current environment, including tests contributed by other installed tiers or
independent test packs.

## Relationship to Features and Profiles

Benchmarks are selected from the features and profiles an asset declares. This
is the same vocabulary used throughout the SimReady specification. A profile bundles
features, and each feature maps to the benchmarks that confirm it. Refer to
[Pipeline and Stages](pipeline.md) for how those declarations become a test plan.

- [Pipeline and Stages](pipeline.md): how features and profiles become a test plan
- [Running Tests](running.md): set up `simready-benchmark`, configure the engine, and run tests
- [Reading Reports](reading-reports.md): interpret results, exit codes, and [verify a clean run](reading-reports.md#verify-a-clean-run)
