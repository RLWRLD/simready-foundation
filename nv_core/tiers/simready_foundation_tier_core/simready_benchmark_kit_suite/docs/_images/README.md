# Test Doc Images

Per-test expected-result frames live in this directory as `<test-name>.png`, and
the matching result videos live in `docs/_static/videos/<test-name>.mp4`. Each
per-test doc embeds its still inline and links its video. The artifacts are
committed into the docset so the docs are self-contained and do not depend on a
local `_testing` run directory.

## How These Were Captured

The stills and videos were taken from a real `simready-benchmark` run. For the dynamic
tests the still is a representative frame extracted from the result video. The
`presence` still is the test's own captured visible frame. The source asset for
each test is listed in the table below.

## Adding the Remaining Captures

Three tests have no artifact yet. To add one, run the test on a suitable asset
through `simready-benchmark`, copy the result video to
`docs/_static/videos/<test-name>.mp4`, save a representative still as
`<test-name>.png` in this directory, then add the inline image and the result
video link to the test doc following the pattern in the other test docs.
