# FET001 Visual

The minimal placeable visual feature: the asset renders, faces the right way, and sits correctly for placement.

`FET001` is the benchmark family label. Its canonical Foundation feature ID is
`FET_001_STANDARD`, which is the ID declared by the enabled test decorators and
feature manifests. A separate manifest with the bare ID `FET001` is neither
required nor expected.

## Overview

This family confirms an asset is visually usable in a scene. The tests verify that the asset produces visible pixels, that its surface normals face outward, that back faces are culled correctly, that the surface responds to lighting, and that the pivot supports ground placement.

## What a Passing Family Means

A reviewer, PM, or OEM can trust that the asset renders as a solid, correctly shaded object. Surface normals face outward, face winding is correct, and the mesh responds to directional lighting. The pivot check is advisory: a sub-threshold result is reported as SKIPPED rather than FAIL, so a passing family does not guarantee ground placement for non-prop object types.
