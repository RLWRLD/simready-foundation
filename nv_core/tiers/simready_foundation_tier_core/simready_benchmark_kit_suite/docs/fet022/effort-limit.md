## Summary

Applies an external force at each joint's child body in 12 directions and verifies
that every driven joint holds its position or fails predictably within its
declared effort limit.

## What Pass Guarantees

A passing result confirms that the joint drives can resist external loads up to
the tested force magnitude and that no joint breaks out of position in a way that
contradicts its authored `driveMaxForce`. Reviewers, PMs, and OEMs can trust that
the articulation will hold a commanded configuration under the loads expected in
typical manipulation tasks.

## What It Checks

The test commands all joints to a stable configuration and then, for each joint,
applies a `force_magnitude_newtons` (default 10.0 N) force at that joint's child
body in each of 12 evenly distributed directions in sequence. After each force application, the test checks whether any joint has moved beyond its authored position limits by more than `break_tolerance` (default 0.10, that is, 10 percent of the joint's authored position range). A joint that exceeds this threshold is counted as failed.
When `stop_on_first_break` is true (default), the test stops at the first failure
to avoid cascading instability.

The total test duration is distributed across all 12 force directions within
`test_duration_seconds` (default 2.0 s).

## How It Works

The robot is held in its configured pose using the drive stiffness and damping
values already authored on the asset. The external force is applied as a
continuous world-frame force at the joint's child body, re-applied every
physics tick through `IPhysxSimulation.apply_force_at_pos`. The simulation runs for each
direction segment, and joint positions are sampled at the end of each segment.
Any joint whose position exceeds its authored limits by more than `break_tolerance` times the joint range is recorded as a failure.

The test does not modify the drive gains or the mass properties of the
articulation. It uses the asset as authored.

## Failure Cases

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Joint breaks away under 10 N external force | `driveMaxForce` too low for the link mass and lever arm; drive stiffness insufficient to resist the applied torque |
| Multiple joints break under the same force direction | Drive parameters globally under-tuned; articulation root mass or inertia values unrealistic |
| Joint breaks only in one force direction | End-effector geometry or link mass asymmetry creates a torque that the joint cannot resist in that configuration |

## How to Fix

If joints break under the default 10 N force, increase `driveMaxForce` on the
failing joint's `UsdPhysicsDriveAPI` to a value that reflects the real robot's
rated torque. Also verify `driveStiffness` and `driveDamping` are high enough to
resist external perturbations in addition to gravity.

Check that link mass and inertia values are physically plausible. Unrealistically
low mass values reduce the effort required to break the joint, making the test
appear to fail even when drive values are correct for the declared mass.

If the asset is not intended to hold under external force (for example, a purely
kinematic articulation), the `force_magnitude_newtons` configuration key can be
reduced to match the expected operating load.

## Expected Result

[Result video](../../../../_static/videos/effort-limit.mp4)

The robot holds a stable configuration while invisible forces are applied at each
joint's child body from multiple directions. No joint visibly moves from its
commanded position. On a passing run, the articulation remains rigid throughout
all 12 force directions per joint.

## Notes and Caveats

The 12 force directions are evenly distributed on the unit sphere. Not all
directions produce equal torque at every joint; a direction aligned with a joint
axis produces minimal torque on that joint while maximizing torque on adjacent
joints.

The test does not check torque values directly. It checks positional compliance,
which is an observable proxy for whether the drives are strong enough to hold the
configuration.
