## Summary

Solves a set of FK-sampled end-effector targets using an in-house damped
least-squares Jacobian solver and verifies that the solver converges within the
iteration budget and position tolerance.

## What Pass Guarantees

A passing result confirms that the articulation's kinematic structure supports
Jacobian-based IK convergence without a Lula descriptor, and that the end
effector can reach a representative sample of configurations within the position
and orientation tolerances. Reviewers, PMs, and OEMs can trust that the robot
joint structure is well-conditioned for numerical IK and that joint limits do not
prevent convergence to sampled configurations.

## What It Checks

The test samples `num_targets` (default 5) end-effector targets by performing
forward kinematics from random joint configurations. These FK-sampled targets are
guaranteed to be reachable by construction. The damped least-squares (DLS)
Jacobian solver is then run from a neutral starting configuration for up to
`max_solver_iterations` (default 150) iterations per target with
`damping_lambda` (default 0.05). A target is considered reached if the final
end-effector position error is within `position_tolerance` (default 0.05 m) and
the orientation error is within `orientation_tolerance_deg` (default 10 degrees).
The test fails when the fraction of targets reached falls below `min_pass_rate`
(default 0.40). The test skips when no end effector can be discovered on the
articulation. The test does not apply to gripper-type robots.

## How It Works

The test uses an in-house DLS Jacobian solver that operates directly on the
articulation state. It does not require a Lula robot descriptor, a URDF, or any
external motion-planning extension. The Jacobian is computed numerically from the
live physics-link pose after finite joint perturbations at each iteration step.
The pose is read from the active backend's articulation tensor view rather than
from authored USD transforms, because Newton does not write simulated link
motion back into the USD stage.

PhysX uses a `finite_difference_epsilon` of 1e-5 rad and one propagation step.
Newton's float32/CUDA state path uses
`newton_finite_difference_epsilon` (default 1e-3 rad) and
`newton_jacobian_propagation_steps` (default 2). These settings make the
numerical derivative observable after a Newton state write; target generation,
solver tolerances, iteration limits, and the minimum pass rate remain shared.

During physical playback, PhysX retains the existing 0.67 s interpolation and
0.3 s hold. Newton uses the configurable `newton_interpolation_seconds`
(default 1.25 s) and `newton_hold_after_reach_seconds` (default 1.0 s) so its
GPU articulation controller receives a gentler simultaneous multi-joint input.
The test logs target-versus-live joint error in radians during playback. These
timing settings do not change position, orientation, or pass-rate tolerances.

FK-sampled targets are produced by setting each joint to a random position within
its limits, reading the resulting end-effector pose, and resetting the
articulation to the neutral configuration before starting the IK solve. This
sampling strategy ensures all targets are kinematically reachable, so low pass
rates indicate solver convergence problems rather than workspace sampling issues.
The run also requires at least two spatially distinct reachable targets when
multiple configurations are requested. This prevents a stale pose source from
passing every target at the starting position without robot travel.

For SCARA-type robots, the targets are sampled on an FK-reach ring rather than a
sphere, to reflect the planar nature of the SCARA workspace.

## Failure Cases

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Pass rate below 40 percent | Jacobian becomes singular near the joint configuration used as the IK starting point; joint limits are too tight to allow the solver to converge |
| Solver exceeds iteration budget without converging | Damping lambda too high (over-regularized); target is near a singularity; stiffness or range asymmetry |
| Test skipped | No end effector discovered on the articulation; robot type is a gripper |
| Internal live-link error | The discovered marker cannot be resolved to a simulated articulation link, or sampled link poses do not change |

## How to Fix

If the pass rate is low, check that the joint limits in the USD asset are wide
enough to allow the solver to maneuver away from the neutral configuration. Very
tight limits around the neutral pose can trap the solver in a local minimum.

If the solver consistently fails to converge, verify that the articulation is not
in a singular configuration at the start of each solve. A neutral configuration
that places the robot in an extended or folded singularity will cause systematic
Jacobian IK failures regardless of the target.

If the test skips due to no end effector being discovered, verify that the
asset's USD hierarchy includes an end-effector prim at the expected location in
the kinematic chain.

## Expected Result

[Result video](../../../../_static/videos/jacobian-ik.mp4)

The robot moves through a sequence of configurations, each corresponding to an
FK-sampled target. At each configuration, the end effector is close to the target
pose. On a passing run, the robot does not get stuck at the neutral configuration
or oscillate during the solve.

## Notes and Caveats

This test is distinct from the ik_target_reach test. The ik_target_reach test
uses the Lula solver (which requires a robot descriptor) and samples targets on
a Fibonacci sphere. The jacobian_ik test uses the in-house DLS solver (no
descriptor required) and samples targets by forward kinematics. The two tests
complement each other: ik_target_reach validates Lula descriptor quality, and
jacobian_ik validates intrinsic joint structure and kinematic well-conditioning.

This test does not apply to gripper-type robots. Grippers have limited kinematic
degrees of freedom that do not support 6-DOF end-effector IK. The test skips on
gripper assets.
