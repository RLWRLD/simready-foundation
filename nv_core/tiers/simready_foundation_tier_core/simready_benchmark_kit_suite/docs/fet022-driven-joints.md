# FET022 Driven Joints

Actively driven joints follow their commands within their declared limits.

## Overview

This family commands the asset's driven joints and confirms that they reach their
targets, respect their velocity and effort limits, honor mimic relationships,
coordinate across multiple joints, and support inverse-kinematics reach. The
tests cover every aspect of joint authoring that determines whether an
articulated asset is controllable at runtime: drive gains, state accuracy,
limit enforcement, parallel linkage coupling, simultaneous coordination, and
end-effector IK.

## What a Passing Family Means

A reviewer, PM, or OEM can trust that the asset's joint drives, limits, and mimic
relationships are authored correctly so the articulation is controllable. The
same reviewer can rely on the family to confirm that the robot or articulated
tool will follow commanded trajectories in simulation, respect the declared
velocity and effort ceilings, and expose a usable IK interface for manipulation
planning.

## Relationship to the Feature

This family validates the runtime behavior described by the
[PhysX](../../../features/FET_022_PHYSX.md),
[Newton](../../../features/FET_022_NEWTON.md), and
[Isaac](../../../features/FET_022_ISAAC.md) FET022 features. The Standard
authoring feature is not directly registered to this runtime suite. MuJoCo
FET022 is not registered by the current implementations.
