"""FET001 Presence / Visibility check (VG.002 -- valid extent).

WHAT: Verifies the asset produces visible pixels when loaded and rendered.
      This is the most basic visual test -- if nothing renders, all other
      visual tests are meaningless.

HOW:  1. Load the asset in a white room with dome lighting and diagnostic
         material (orange, matte).
      2. Settle (let geometry load) BEFORE framing the camera -- the bbox
         computation requires loaded geometry to produce correct results.
      3. Capture a check frame and verify the diagnostic material (orange)
         is visible. If no orange pixels are detected, FAIL immediately
         (object not on screen).
      4. Capture a background frame with the asset hidden.
      5. Capture a visible frame with the asset shown.
      6. Compare the two frames pixel-by-pixel. If the difference exceeds
         the threshold (default 1%), the asset has visible geometry.

WHY:  VG.002 requires boundable geometry with valid extent. If the asset
      has no renderable meshes, broken references, or all-invisible prims,
      the visible frame will be identical to the background -> test fails.

FALSE POSITIVE AVOIDANCE:
  - Visibility pre-check prevents false passes on empty frames (broken
    load, wrong camera framing).
  - Uses diagnostic material to eliminate material-dependent rendering
    issues (transparent materials, broken textures).
  - White room ensures the background is uniform and predictable.
  - Dome-only lighting (no directional) avoids uneven wall illumination.
  - Very low threshold (1%) accommodates small objects that occupy few pixels.
  - If the asset has only non-mesh geometry (curves, points), it may fail
    this test even though geometry exists. This is intentional: FET001
    requires Mesh representation (VG.MESH.001).
