"""FET003 Ground Drop + Stability test (RB.001 / RB.007).

WHAT: Drop the asset from N x its height onto a flat ground plane, verify
      it touches the ground, does not penetrate, and comes to rest.  Combines
      the former ground_drop (RB.001) and ground_stability (RB.007) tests
      into one simulation to avoid paying the setup + boot cost twice.

HOW:  1. Load asset in blue room with collision ground.
      2. Place asset at drop_height_factor * bbox_height above ground.
      3. Run pre-simulation safeguards (world-anchor, rigid body checks).
      4. Simulate at 240 fps with camera follow.
      5. Each frame:
         - Check ground touch (bbox z_min crossing floor + floor_margin).
         - Check penetration (bbox z_min below floor - floor_margin).
         - After the post-touch penetration window, begin rest detection:
           track bbox centre + corners over a sliding hold window and
           declare rest when both stay within tolerance.
      6. Early-exit: stop simulating as soon as rest is detected (+ short
         tail for the video).  This is the main win over running a fixed
         simulation_seconds every time.

PASS/FAIL:
  - PASS: touched + no penetration + rest detected within
          rest_detection_max_seconds after the first ground touch.
  - FAIL: never touched, or penetrated after touch, or oscillated without
          settling within the rest deadline.

FALSE POSITIVE AVOIDANCE:
  - floor_margin (0.1m) tolerance for floating-point collision resolution.
  - 1-second penetration window catches transient vs sustained penetration.
  - World-anchor detection skips test for anchored assets.
  - RigidBody pre-check catches assets with no physics setup.
  - Mesh cooking safeguards in load_asset() prevent PhysX hangs.
  - ctx.get_asset_bounds() tracks actual physics body, not root xform.
  - Rest uses bbox min + max corners so rotation without translation is
    still detected (a spinning object is not at rest).
