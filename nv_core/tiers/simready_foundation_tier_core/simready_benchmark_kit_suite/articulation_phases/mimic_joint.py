# Library philosophy: when a
# test cannot run on (or fails on) an asset, the message MUST teach the asset
# author EXACTLY how to fix the asset. Each helper builds a message with:
#   1) headline naming the failure,
#   2) what the test found vs. what was expected,
#   3) which prim(s)/attribute(s) need editing,
#   4) a paste-ready USDA snippet OR a concrete edit instruction,
#   5) REFERENCE to the spec doc + a working real-asset example.
