"""JIK phase: Jacobian-based Inverse Kinematics for any articulated robot.
V1 references:
  - shared_phases/jacobian_ik.py (orchestration, target generation,
    success-rate gating).
  - shared_phases/jik_execution.py (precompute, motion interpolation,
    teleport, hold).

This module merges both v1 files into one Framework 2.0 phase with the
simplified contract ``async def run_jacobian_ik(ctx, robot, scene_info,
config) -> None``. The viewport legend authoring (target spheres, on-
screen text), v1's split-OOR / inverted-mount workspace heuristics, and
the cascading-failure / dgv-aware error messages are intentionally
dropped (spec scope cuts).

The damped least-squares solver itself is shared with the IK phase and
lives in ``jik_solver.py``. v2's solver is sync; the phase below is
responsible for stepping physics around solve calls so USD xform caches
reflect current articulation state.

# Fix-message helpers (asset-author guidance)
#
# Library philosophy: when JIK cannot run on -- or fails on -- an asset, the
# message in result.json / HTML report is the ONLY signal the asset author
# gets back from CI. Each message below names the failure, prints what the
# test found vs. expected, points at the prim(s) that need editing, gives a
# paste-ready USDA snippet (or concrete edit instruction with example
# values), and ends with a REFERENCE block pointing to the spec docs and a
# working real-asset example.
