"""IK Target Reach phase (Lula solver) -- Framework 2.0 port from v1.6.

Merges v1's ``shared_phases/ik_target_reach.py`` (orchestration, Lula solver
build, EE discovery) with ``shared_phases/ik_execution.py`` (precompute,
motion interpolation, teleport, hold) into a single phase module.

Public phase entry point:
    async def run_ik_target_reach(ctx, robot, scene_info, config) -> None

Pure helpers exposed for unit testing:
- ``get_defaults() -> Dict[str, Any]``
- ``aggregate_ik_summary(per_target_results) -> Dict[str, Any]``
- ``select_lula_robot_name(robot_type_name, asset_name, override) -> Optional[str]``
- ``default_ee_candidates(robot_name) -> List[str]``

Viewport legend authoring (target spheres, color, text overlays) is NOT
ported; it is intentionally deferred per spec Section 1.2.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Failure-message helpers
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Library philosophy: when a test cannot run on (or fails on) an asset, the
# failure message must teach the asset author EXACTLY how to fix the asset.
# Generic "could not solve IK" / "no descriptor" is useless to an author --
# they need (1) which prim/attribute to edit, (2) example good values, and
# (3) a spec reference + a real-asset example to copy from.
#
# These helpers are exposed at module scope (not nested) so the test
# harness can render them in result.json + the HTML report without any
# string surgery, and so they remain unit-testable.
