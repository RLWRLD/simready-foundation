"""STA phase: per-joint commanded-position accuracy + state-reporting sanity.
V1 reference: shared_phases/state_accuracy.py.

Algorithm matches v1 (post-Fanuc smoke run 2026-04-24):
- Per joint, command a 5-step sequence around 0: [center, +step, center, -step, center].
  The step is min(15 deg, 10% of joint range) so heavy industrial arms with default
  drive gains can reach each waypoint inside the test window.
- Position tolerance is 5 degrees by default (matches v1). Failing on a tighter rad
  tolerance with full-range targets caused Fanuc CR/CRX joints to fail STA on the
  first smoke run.
- Velocity-reporting consistency and reading consistency are LOGGED, not failed.
  Only position-tracking error past tolerance fails the joint.
