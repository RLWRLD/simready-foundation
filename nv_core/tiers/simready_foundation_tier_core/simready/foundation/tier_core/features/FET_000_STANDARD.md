## Description

The Core feature defines the minimum standard structure for a portable SimReady
USD asset. It covers asset file naming, directory layout, path portability,
metadata location, resolvable asset paths, SimReady metadata, and undefined
prim cleanup.

This is the neutral, OpenUSD-only Core contract and does not require any
physics runtime variants or Isaac packaging rules. Runtime-specific physics
variant scaffolding is provided by the runtime Core features
[`FET_000_PHYSX`](FET_000_PHYSX.md), [`FET_000_NEWTON`](FET_000_NEWTON.md),
and [`FET_000_MUJOCO`](FET_000_MUJOCO.md). Isaac packaging and physics-layer
placement are provided by [`FET_000_ISAAC`](FET_000_ISAAC.md). Each of those
features depends on this feature.

An asset that satisfies this feature can be discovered, loaded, packaged, and
validated as a well-formed SimReady USD asset before additional visual,
material, physics, robot, or runtime-specific feature contracts are applied.

## Dependency Graph

This feature has no dependencies and no other features depend on it directly.

## Use Cases

- Baseline SimReady asset validation.
- USD asset packaging and portability checks.
- Shared prerequisite checks for higher-level SimReady profiles.
- Early validation of exported assets before runtime-specific feature authoring.
