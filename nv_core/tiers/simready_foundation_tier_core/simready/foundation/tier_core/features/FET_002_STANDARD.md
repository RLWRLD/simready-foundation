## Description

The Posable Bodies feature defines the standard OpenUSD contract for an asset
whose visible body can be posed by applying transform edits to its body
hierarchy.

An asset that satisfies this feature has visible imageable geometry, a valid
default prim entry point, and geometry organized under xform parents with
authored translation and rotation operations. This lets authoring tools,
runtime tests, and animation workflows apply USD transform overrides and
observe visible changes without requiring runtime-specific physics schemas.

## Dependency Graph

This feature has no dependencies and no other features depend on it directly.

## Use Cases

- USD transform and posing tests for visible body assets.
- Authoring workflows that need a visible asset body to be repositioned,
  rotated, or animated through xform operations.
- Pre-physics body hierarchy checks before rigid-body, multibody, grasp, or
  robot-specific features are applied.
- Runtime benchmark workflows that apply transform overrides and compare
  rendered output.

## Pipelines

Source file type:

- `.usd` / `.usda`
  - Via USD authoring tools that emit visible geometry under xformable body
    hierarchy.

Validation or runtime pipeline:

- SimReady validation - verifies the Posable Bodies requirement IDs listed in
  the selected `FET_002_STANDARD` manifest.
- No Benchmark runtime test is currently registered for this feature.
