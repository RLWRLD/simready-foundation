# Feature: `FET_001_STANDARD`

| **Property**            | **Value**         |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Feature Name            | `FET_001_STANDARD` |
| Runtime                 | `STANDARD` |
| Proprietary Techs       | `None` |
| Latest Version          | `1.0.1` |

## Description

The Minimal Placeable Visual feature defines the standard OpenUSD contract for
an asset that can be loaded, placed, transformed, and rendered as a visible
object in a broad range of applications.

An asset that satisfies this feature has supported asset paths and file types,
known stage units and up axis, a valid default prim, a single xformable root for
placement, mesh-based visible geometry, authored extents, valid mesh topology,
valid normals and winding, and an origin placement suitable for aggregation
into scenes.

## Dependency Graph

This feature has no JSON feature dependencies. In normal profile workflows it
is validated after `FET_000_STANDARD` because Core establishes the asset layout,
metadata, and path contract that Minimal builds on.

## Use Cases

- Synthetic data generation and scene assembly.
- Robotics and simulation asset placement.
- Visual inspection of converted CAD, DCC, MJCF, or USD assets.
- Baseline renderability checks before physics, materials, grasp, robot, or
  runtime-specific features are applied.
